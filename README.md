# Mic
Mic is a program that makes it possible to write with a few taps.
Just start the program and then tap according to alphabet image.
Let me give an example:
  You want to write the letter "k",in order to do it you have to first tap 3 times,then wait for 4 seconds and tap once so you decide that it is the first order.Then tap 2 times and wait again for 4 seconds.Then tap once again and it will print the letter "k".After that the program will continue listening your taps.
